= Clojure Template Project

A simple template for Clojure projects

== Overview

This Clojure project shows my favorite layout of for both source & test files
(sample Java source is included as well).  The project is also set-up to use the
https://github.com/cloojure/tupelo[Tupelo Clojure] library and the
https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh[lein-test-refresh] plugin.

== How to User This Project

To use this project, we assume you have already installed Java, Clojure, and Leiningen, and `git`.

=== Clone the Project Using Git

Verify you have Git installed:

```bash
> git --version
git version 2.25.0
```

Use `git` to clone the project (via SSH) into a new project names `demo`:
```bash
> git clone  git@github.com:io-tupelo/clj-template.git  demo  # git ssh URL
```

or, clone via HTTPS (if you don't have SSH set up on your computer & GitHub):
```bash
> git clone  https://github.com/io-tupelo/clj-template.git  demo  # git https URL
```

Then `cd` (change directory) into the new project:

```bash
> cd demo
```

=== Verify you have Java, Clojure, and Leiningen set up correctly

Try the following commands, and make sure you get similar output:

```bash
> java --version
java 13 2019-09-17
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 13+33)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 13+33, mixed mode, sharing)

> lein --version
Leiningen 2.9.1 on Java 13 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
```

== Running Unit Tests - Plain

```pre
> lein clean
> lein test
```

with result:

```pre
lein test _bootstrap
-------------------------------
   Clojure 1.10.1    Java 13
-------------------------------

lein test tst.demo.core
result => "Hello, World!\n"

Ran 4 tests containing 6 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
```

I do the above so often that I have a Bash/Zsh alias set up:

```bash
alias lct="time (lein do clean, test)"       # lct => Lein Clean Test
```

== Running Unit Tests with `lein test-refresh`

IMHO, https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh[the lein-test-refresh project] provides the best way of doing
iterative development in Clojure, re-running unit tests every time you save a source file from the editor.

```pre
> lein test-refresh
```

or make an alias:

```bash
alias lctr="lein do clean, test-refresh"    # lctr => Lein Clean Test-Refresh
```

with result:

```pre
Testing _bootstrap
-------------------------------
   Clojure 1.10.1    Java 13
-------------------------------

Testing tst.demo.core
result => "Hello, World!\n"

Ran 4 tests containing 6 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.

Passed all tests
Finished at 07:56:48.252 (run time: 6.709s)
...
```

in this instance, the test output pauses after printing the elapsed time, and waits to re-run
upon any file change. For example, make a simple change in the namespace `demo.core`  by adding
the word "Again!" to the `println` expression, and watch as the tests are automatically re-run:

```pre
...
Testing tst.demo.core
result => "Hello, World! Again!\n"
...
Finished at 07:59:53.863 (run time: 0.034s)
```

Note that the tests were all re-run in only 34 milliseconds (nearly instantaneous), since the JVM was already
started and Clojure itself (plus library code) has already been compiled.

=== Using "Focus" Mode

Change one of the `dotest` forms in `tst.demo.core` to `dotest-focus`.  If there is at least one `dotest-focus` present
in the project, then ***only*** the "focus" tests will be run.  This is helpful when you want to
temporarily focus on a specific feature, without the distraction of all the other tests runnning.

Note that only `lein test-refresh` (i.e. `lctr`) will honor the `focus` mode; `lein test` (i.e. `lct`) will always run all tests.

== Keeping Dependency Versions Up-To-Date

This project includes the `lein-ancient` plugin, which will tell you if any of your dependency
libraries are out of date. I have an alias:

```bash
alias laca="lein ancient check :all"
```

which will give you a list of version updates you should make, or just

```pre
all artifacts are up-to-date.
```

if you are already up-to-date on everything.

== Plumatic Schema

The function `demo.core/add2` shows the usage of https://github.com/plumatic/schema[Plumatic Schema] to document
function argument types and return value type.  This is a lifesaver!
